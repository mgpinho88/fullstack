## 01 :: The Basics
JavaScript comes equipt with a handful of "building blocks" known as the primitive types. These are the fundamental parts of the JavaScript language akin to the parts of an atom. The primitives include:
* Number - unlike other computer languages there is one number type. The number primitive is a representation of a number in the language. These can be whole numbers, negative numbers and decimals.
  * NAN (Not a Number) - technically IS a number in JavaScript. This value is similar to an "undefined" number. Operations such as dividing by zero will result in a NAN 
* String - Can be a single character or a whole line of typed out text
* Boolean - true and false
* Null
* Undefined
