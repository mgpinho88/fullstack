# Basics Exercises
## 01 :: Function Expression Exercise
Define a function that returns the `square` of a number. D**efine the function as a function expression, stored in a variable called `square`.  NOTE: Udemy's coding exercise platform does NOT support the `**` operator.** 
```JavaScript
square(4) //16
square(3) //9
```

## 02 :: Methods Exercise
Define an object called `square`, which will hold methods that have to do with the geometry of squares. It should contain two methods, `area` and `perimeter
* `area` should accept the length of a `side` (all sides are the same in a square) and then return the `side` squared. 
* `perimeter` should accept the length of a `side` and return that `side` multiplied by 4.
```JavaScript
square.area(10) //100
square.perimeter(10) //40
```
