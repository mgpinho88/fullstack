// Your code goes in here:
// bestColor should be set to the string purple (the best color on planet earth, as we all know);
let bestColor = "purple";
//quote should be set to the string You had me at "hello" - be careful about quotation marks, we want double quotes inside the string.
let quote = "You had me at \"hello\"";
