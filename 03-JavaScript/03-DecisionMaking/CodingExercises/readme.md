# Decision Making Exercises
## 01 :: Our First Conditional Exercise
Let's get some practice with conditional statements!  In order to make your code repeatable and testable, I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function (something we have not yet covered in the course). 
* Write your code between the two comments in `index.js`
* You will automatically have access to a variable called `num`.  **Please do not try and define num or change num in any way!** I will be setting the value of `num` when I test your code, so that I can test different outcomes
* **If `num` is an even number, print out "even".  Don't do anything if num is an odd number.**

## 02 :: getColor Conditional Exercise
Let's get some practice with conditional statements!  In order to make your code repeatable and testable, I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function (something we have not yet covered in the course). 
* Write your code between the two comments in `index.js`
* You will automatically have access to a variable called `phrase`.  **Please do not try and define phrase or change phrase in any way!** I will be setting the value of `phrase` when I test your code.
* Your job is to print out a color based upon the following rules:
``` JavaScript
if phrase is 'stop', you should print out 'red'
if phrase is 'slow', you should print out 'yellow'
if phrase is 'go', you should print out 'green'
if phrase is anything else, you should print out 'purple'
```

## 03 :: Nested Conditionals Practice
Time for something a little bit different. I've given you a nested conditional that uses a variable called `num`.  I would like for you to change the value of `num` to another number, so that **"YOU GOT ME!"** is printed out. Don't change anything other than the value of `num`!  Leave the conditional alone!

## 04 :: Logical AND Mystery Exercise
I've provided you with a conditional statement that uses a variable called `mystery`  **Please change the value of** `mystery` so that the conditional is true and "YOU GOT IT" is printed to the console.  Do not change anything other than the value of `mystery` on line 1!
