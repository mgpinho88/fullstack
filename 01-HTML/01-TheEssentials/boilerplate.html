        Since having done previous bootcamps and having already learned the basics of HTML most of this opening section
        will remain sparse. Already being a developer this content is not used much in practice so while it might be
        useful to re-educate after some time away, to keep detailed notes will take up too much time. Successful
        completion of the excercises in this section is enough for practice.
