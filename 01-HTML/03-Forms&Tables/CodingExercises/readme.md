# Forms & Tables Exercises
## 01 :: Table Practice Exercise
It's time to get some practice with all those table-related elements! (yikes)  Your goal is to create a 3x3 table, with proper headings. (so it's really 4x3 if you count the heading cells)  I've provided you with some starter data in `index.html`, though you do not have to use it.  Just make sure you create a 3x3 table with a row of headings at the top, using the correct semantic elements. You are expected to use the following elements: `table`, `thead`, `tr`, `th`, `tbody`, and `td`

Here is what the table would look like with the starter data provided in `index.html`:

## 02 :: Forms Practice Exercise
Let's get some practice with forms, inputs, labels, and buttons! Write a simple form with the following inputs:

1. Username
    1. Text Input
    2. Should have placeholder text of 'username'
    3. Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

2. Password
    1. Password Input
    2. Should have placeholder text of 'password'
    3. Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)

3. A Button
    1. With the inner text 'Register'
    
**I added in some `<div>` elements for spacing, but you don't need to:**
