# Full Stack Web Development
## The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele

This repository is for my uploads from the Colt Steele bootcamp course. I have divided the course into various sections as depicted by the table of content. In addition, there will be a lot of code which was downloaded directly from Colt Steele's course so not all the content is my own in this repo. For the most part any of the exercises and practices will be my own implementation but for the lecture sections they will be copy/paste code. In each section there will be a breif write-up summary of what was learned in the entirety of the section.
